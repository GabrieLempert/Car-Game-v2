# Car-Game-v2


Made a Car game for mobile development course in my bachelors degree in computer science,

Learned to implement threads on mobile, how to create a stage in Android studio and basics things XML and etc.

In the game you need to drive with a car and escape obstacles by using left and right arrows,
we built it without using any animations only threads, the user gets 3 lives to play each game.

The v2 version is a bit compliacted it holds a use of firebase API with map callings and use of sesnsors to it's implemntion.
